# Brownie in a box

## Welcome

This code simulates brownian motion in a 2d box for a single bacterium that
can die, reproduce (which now means just stopping there for a simulation turn)
or keep moving by that brownian motion. The results are then plotted

As of now, the documentation and the code itself are a WORK IN PROGRESS

## Dependencies

numpy, matplotlib for brownie_box.py

everything listed for brownie_box.py and pytest for tests.py
